Hi, I'm Kara 👋. I'm an animal behaviorist transitioning into the world of software development. Currently studying with CodePlatoon, I am developing skills in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you follow my repositories over the next several months you'll find a plethora of coding exercises and projects as I hit the ground running.
</p>
<p>
As I embark on this journey, I plan to advance my skills to be applied toward the development of applications and technologies research in conservation and animal welfare. I believe learning is a life-long adventure with opportunities where we least expect them. As such, I am eager to join an organization with opportunities for growth and innovation where I can apply my skills and passion to further not only my own goals but those of the team.
